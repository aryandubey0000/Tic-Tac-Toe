# Tic Tac Toe Website

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe** game! This is a simple web-based version of the classic game, where two players can compete against each other on the same device.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on the grid.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Game Reset**: After a game ends, players can easily reset the board to start a new game.
- **Player vs. Player**: Two players take turnsâ€”no AI opponent is involved.
- **Win Condition Detection**: The game automatically detects and displays the winner, or indicates a draw if there are no more moves possible.

## Usage

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
3. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if the board is full and there is no winner (a draw).
4. After a game ends, you can click the "Restart" button to begin a new game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players alternate turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on an empty square.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins.
- If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game results in a draw.

## Technologies Used
